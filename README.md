# JNRPE - Java Nagios Remote Plugin Executor

JNRPE is a java porting of the [Nagios NRPE addon](https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nrpe).

The project is divided into a set of modules:
* The JNRPE Server: the java equivalent of the NRPE server
* The jcheck_nrpe: the java implementation of the `check_nrpe` command
* The JNRPE Library: the core of the implementation as a java library. 
This library can be embedded into your own application to give that the ability
to be queried by Nagios.
* The JNRPE Plugins: a library containing all the JNRPE provided plugins.
Other plugins can be easily added.
* The JNRPE install: a graphical installer package powered by [IzPack](http://izpack.org).
